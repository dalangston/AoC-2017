## AoC 2017 Day 04
Validating passphrases

### Part 1
New policy requires pass*phrses*, not pass*words*.  Valid passphrases contain:
- Two or more "words"
- No two "words" in a phrase are the same

Parse the passphrase list and count the number of valid passphrases

### Part 2
Updated policy requires that no two "words" in the passphrase are anagrams of eachother.
